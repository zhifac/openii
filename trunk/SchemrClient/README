Requirements
------------
- Eclipse 3.4 with plugins for RCP and JEE development
- Subversive plugin for SVN access
- SchemaStore webservice

Running
-------
- Set up SchemaStore (see SchemaStore)
	- set up postgresql 8.3 
		- run schema_store.sql to make schema and data
	- set up tomcat5.5
		- configure db access credentials
		- deploy SchemaStore.war
- Configure SchemaStore URL
- Run Schemr as Eclipse Application
	- the first run will create a client-side text index of all schemas in repository

Developing
----------
(optional)
- SWT v3.4 for Eclipse Ganymede source code: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/eclipse.php
- Prefuse source code: www.prefuse.org

Updating
--------
- When SchemaStore, SchemaStoreClient or Ygg changes
	- Run *.jardesc

BEWARE!
-----
- xercesImpl.jar should be included on classpath w/ Linux and Windows platforms, but NOT on OS X Java 1.4+

Major issues / todos
--------------------
- Configurable SchemaStore URL, index location
- Button for refreshing index
- install procedure, test

- Memory leak? Probably MatchSummary objects sticking around... or the AWT-SWT bridge not behaving

- Using Lucene index probably introduces a recall problem
- Test schemr recall/precision against something... like a TF/IDF score of itself
- Lucene index is static... build.xml regenerates, as well as if you delete the index folder (for now)

- Define collaborative use cases
- Push Lucene text index to server-side OR! push matching to Lucene

- Define Eclipse plugin extension points
- Refactor for extensibility
