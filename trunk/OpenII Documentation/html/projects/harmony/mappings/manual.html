			<h1>Manual Schema Element Matching</h1>

			<div class="chapter">
				<a name="introduction"></a>
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>
					Although Harmony is principally designed as a tool for employing automated
					schema matching algorithms it is often the case that manual methods must be
					employed to address shortcomings in (or to finalize) the automated analysis.
					Where there is significant domain knowledge available but documented element
					metadata is poor it may be necessary to establish element links manually.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="chapter">
				<a name="creation"></a>
				<h3>Link Creation</h3>

				<p>
					To manually create a link between two schema elements, select an element in
					one schema and drag (with the mouse left-button depressed) to an element in
					the other schema. Harmony will display a black line between them since
					user-generated links are always assigned a level of confidence of 1.0
					(see <a href="./../mappings.html#inspecting">Inspecting Mappings</a>).
				</p>

				<p>
					Metadata regarding that link may be accessed by right-clicking on that line
					to bring up the <b>Annotations</b> dialog. The line turns blue, indicating
					that it has been selected, and the element description dialogs (see
					<a href="./../schemas.html#elementdescriptions">Element Descriptions</a>) for
					the two linked elements are automatically displayed.
				</p>

				<p>
					A sample Annotations dialog is as follows:
					<img src="./../../../support/harmony/images/image040.png" alt=""/>
				</p>

				<p>
					The <b>Date</b> indicates the date on which the link was created or last
					edited; it is system-determined.
				</p>

				<p>
					Harmony auto-populates the <b>Author</b> field based on the Windows user
					account that started Harmony. If desired, it may be changed.
				</p>

				<p>
					By default, Harmony provides two fields for annotation, labeled <b>Transform</b>
					and <b>Notes</b>; both are simple text fields.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The <b>Transform</b> field is intended to store metadata regarding how the
						link was generated; this is particularly useful when automated schema
						matching methods are employed. In the case of manual schema matching the
						value "manual" may be appropriate, or the value may be left unspecified.
					</li>
					<li>
						The <b>Notes</b> field contains free-form comments entered by the analyst.
						It may also be left unspecified.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Selecting <b>Accept</b> and then <b>OK</b> will confirm the confidence score
					as 1.0; the dialog will close and the link color will remain black.
				</p>

				<p>
					Selecting <b>Reject</b> and then <b>OK</b> will close the dialog and delete
					the match link.
				</p>

				<p>
					Selecting <b>Cancel</b> will simply close the dialog; any changes made to
					dialog fields will be lost.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Link Management</h3>

				<p>
					In addition to link-by-link inspection, several other mechanisms are available
					to process links. More than a single link may be selected by either:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Holding down the CTRL-key while repeatedly selecting links with the left-button, or
					</li>
					<li>
						Executing "rubber-band multi-select" by using a left-button down-and-drag maneuver
						to select all links intersecting the rectangle thus defined.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					In the case of multi-select the <b>Annotations</b> dialog (activated by a right-click)
					summarizes the values for all multi-selected links, and takes the indicated action on
					all included links when the dialog is closed.
				</p>

				<p>
					The <b>Edit</b> menu includes functions for selecting or removing links, as follows:
					<img src="./../../../support/harmony/images/image042.png" alt=""/>
				</p>
 
 				<ul>
					<li>
						The "Edit &raquo; Select Links..." menu entry selection activates the <b>Select
						Links</b> dialog, as follows: <img src="./../../../support/harmony/images/image043.png" alt=""/>
						<p class="caption">
							This dialog allows the filtered-selection of links.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						The "Edit &raquo; Delete Links..." menu entry selection activates the <b>Delete
						Links</b> dialog, as follows: <img src="./../../../support/harmony/images/image044.png" alt=""/>
						<p class="caption">
							This dialog allows the filtered-deletion of links.
						</p>
					</li>
 				</ul>

				<h3>Link Finishing</h3>

				<p>
					In order to constrain the focus of the automated schema matchers, nodes may
					be marked as "finished".
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							All match links involving a given entity schema element and its node
							descendants will be marked as "finished" (with their existing level
							of confidence) by selecting that schema element with the right
							mouse-button pop-up menu and then selecting "<b>Mark as Finished</b>".
						</p>
						<p>
							That menu appears as follows in the context is which it is enabled;
							e.g., if the "1 Agriculture and Food" node was selected then the following
							would appear: <img src="./../../../support/harmony/images/image045.png" alt=""/>
						</p>
 						<p>
 							The node-icons will subsequently reflect this change by including a
 							check-mark (green for leaf nodes, red for interior nodes).
 						</p>
 					</li>
 					<li>
						<p>
							If the given schema element has already been "marked as finished" (thus
							showing a check-mark in its node-icon) then the right mouse-button
							pop-up menu will instead include the option of "<b>Mark as Unfinished</b>".
						</p>
						<p>
							That menu appears as follows in the context is which it is enabled;
							e.g., if the "1 Agriculture and Food" node was selected then the following
							would appear: <img src="./../../../support/harmony/images/image046.png" alt=""/>
						</p>
						<p>
							All match links involving that entity element and its node descendants will
							be marked as "<b>Unfinished</b>" (with their existing level of confidence).
							The node-icons will subsequently reflect this change by removing the check-mark.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Nodes that are marked as "finished" will be ignored in the automated schema matching process.
