				<h3>Background</h3>

				<p>
					Harmony is a tool designed to assist in the task of data integration: the
					process of merging data from different sources. For example, imagine that the
					U.S. Army has a database which includes a field called "target_loc" which
					stores the location of a potential target as a pair of latitude and longitude
					values. The U.S. Navy might have an XML schema with an entity that also
					represents the location of an enemy target, but it is called "EnemyLocation"
					and is stored using a different coordinate system. Without data integration,
					the two military services will not be able to use each other's data or indeed
					may not even know that the other has the data in question.
				</p>

				<p> 
					If the Army and Navy were to, in advance, carefully compare the Army database
					schema to the Navy's XML schema, they could identify that "target_loc" and
					"EnemyLocation" represent the same kind of data. Given similarity in missions,
					possibly other data type matches exist as well between the service-specific
					data schemas.
				</p>

				<p>
					Without a tool like Harmony, data integration can be very time-consuming,
					especially if the data schemas are large. Data integration specialists often
					spend weeks poring over spreadsheets creating the mappings more or less
					"by	hand". Harmony is designed to make data schema matching much easier and
					faster. Our experience with several large tasks has shown a dramatic reduction
					in the time -- informally, around an 80% reduction -- needed to create a
					complete mapping between two data schemas as compared to working with
					spreadsheets alone.

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<h4>Schema</h4>
				<p>
					A structured representation of a set of concepts and the relationships between
					them. Examples of schemas include database schemas, XML schemas, and OWL ontologies.
				</p>

				<h4>Element</h4>
				<p>
					The basic unit of data in a schema. Examples of elements include database
					fields, XML elements, and OWL elements.
				</p>

				<h4>Source and Target</h4>
				<p>
					A source (schema) contains elements that are being "mapped-from" while a target
					(schema) contains those elements that are being "mapped-to". In the GUI, sources
					will be on the left and targets on the right. The user specifies which schema is
					to be the source and which schema is to be the target for any given mapping.
				</p>

				<h4>Link</h4>
				<p>
					A relationship from an element in a source schema to an element in a target schema.
				</p>

				<h4>Mapping</h4>
				<p>
					The set of all links between elements in a given schema-pair (source, target).
				</p>

				<h4>Graph Model</h4>
				<p>
					A view of a schema which ignores some relationships within the schema to produce
					a tree. Schemas in Harmony are always displayed using tree-based graph models.
					<sup>[<a href="#footnote1">1</a>]</sup>
				</p>

				<h4>Project</h4> 
				<p>
					A named set of two or more schemas with zero or more associated schema-pair mappings.

				<h3>Components</h3>

				<p>
					Harmony consists of three major components.
				</p>

				<h4>Data Repository</h4>
				<p>
					Harmony uses an internal database (by default an open-source Apache Derby database)
					to store schemas (converted to a custom format known as M3), mappings, annotations,
					and relationships between schemas (e.g., extensions). Various tools are provided
					for working with the data repository, so the user does not need to interact with it
					directly. Those tools will be explained throughout this document where relevant to
					the task at hand.
				</p>

				<h4>Automatic Matchers</h4>
				<p>
					Several automated schema matchers are included with Harmony. They use clues like the
					similarity of element names, the words in description fields, and the structure of
					the schemas to provide candidate mappings. While they are far from perfect, it is
					generally much faster for a user to begin with an automatic mapping and then modify
					it than to create the mapping from scratch. Included automatic matchers are described
					in the section <a href="mappings/automatic.html#matchers">Element Matchers</a>.
				</p>

				<h4>Graphical User Interface</h4>
				<p>
					The Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides a graphical representation of the schemas
					and the mappings between them as well as a central "command center" for all of the
					various tools associated with Harmony. The rest of this document will explain how to
					accomplish various tasks from within the GUI.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Harmony framework is also designed to be extensible. Developers may create their
					own schema importers, mapping importers/exporters, and automatic matchers. Development
					of those extensions is, however, outside the scope of this user guide.
				</p>

				<h3>Footnotes</h3>
				<p>
					<a target="footnote1">1.</a> Note that, in general, schemas may be cyclical or
					disconnected, while Harmony is only capable of displaying trees â€“ connected
					graphs where there is a root element and a series of "contained elements",
					which may themselves contain a series of "contained elements", and so on until
					the leaf elements are reached.
