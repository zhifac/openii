			<h1>Welcome to OpenII</h1>
			<p>
				OpenII is a collaborative effort spearheaded by The MITRE Corporation to create a suite
				of open-source tools for information integration. The project is leveraging the latest
				developments in research on information integration to create a platform on which integration
				applications can be built and further research can be conducted.  Our goal is to create tools
				that can be applied in a variety of architectural contexts and can easily be tailored to the
				needs of particular domains.  OpenII tools include, among others, wrappers for common data
				sources, tools for creating matches and mappings between disparate schemas, a tool for searching
				collections of schemas and extending schemas,  and run-time tools for processing queries over
				heterogeneous data sources.

				<!-- MANAGING THE DATA -->
				<div>
					<div class="header">Managing the Data</div>
					<ul>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./management/repositories/index.html">Repository Management</a>
							<p>
								Various schema repositories can be accessed through OpenII.  This section
								discusses how connections can be made to local, remote, and server based
								schema repositories and the types of actions which can be performed on these
								repositories.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./management/schemas/index.html">Schema Management</a>
							<p>
								Within each schema repository are stored a list of schemas.  This section
								discusses management of these schemas, how they can be imported and 
								exported, how they can be grouped through the use of tagging, how they can
								searched, and the various ways in which they can be viewed.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./management/projects/index.html">Project Management</a>
							<p>
								Projects can be set up to develop associations/mappings between schemas.  This
								section discusses the creation of these projects, the various tools available
								for generating associations between these schemas, and the multiple ways that
								users can utilize these associations.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<!-- WORK PROCESSES -->
				<div>
					<div class="header">Work Processes</div>
					<ul>
						<li class="subheader">
							Schema Management Workflow
							<p>
								Some users view this tool suite as a useful schema repository.  This workflow
								discusses the various capabilities available from storage abilities, search
								and viewing capabilities, as well as export options.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							Message Transform Workflow
							<p>
								The transformation problem deals with the situation where the user has a known
								set of data sources which needs to be transformed into a single data standard.
								This workflow discusses the steps needed to import the data sources, create
								a mapping between these data sources, and generate code to perform the
								transformation.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							Common Ground Workflow
							<p>
								Some users have a large pool of data sources from which they need to discover
								any associations which might exist between them or to a single data standard.
								This workflow discusses the steps required to move from discovering these
								associations to identifying a central set of data fields which are common
								among the group.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<!--  USING THE TOOLS -->
				<div>
					<div class="header">Using The Tools</div>
					<ul>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./projects/affinity/index.html">Affinity</a>
							<p>
								Affinity is used for finding associations between members of a generic
								group of data sources.  Through this tool, users can see which data sources
								are closely associated, inspect the reason for these associations, and then
								perform actions on these closely related data sources.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./projects/harmony/index.html">Proximity</a>
							<p>
								Proximity is used to examine the exact alignment of a single data source with other
								data sources in a selected group.  This view allows one to see a ranking of
								the most closely aligned data sources as well as detailed information on
								why these alignments took place.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./projects/harmony/index.html">Harmony</a>
							<p>
								Harmony is used to generate mappings between pairings of data sources.  This
								tool takes a semi-automated approach where algorithms attempt first guess
								estimates of associated data fields.  Then, users can examine these linkages
								to verify and annotate these linkages.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./projects/unity/index.html">Unity</a>
							<p>
								Unity is used to create a collective vocabulary for a group of schemas by
								examining the mappings generated by tools such as Harmony.  This vocabulary
								can then be used to help refine future matching inside of the domain or to
								help construct a messaging standard through which the schemas can communicate.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./projects/rmap/index.html">RMap</a>
							<p>
								RMap is used to generate transformation code between a pair of relational
								schemas.  The resultant SQL code can be used to take data from the source
								schema and transform it into a format which can be accepted by the target
								schema.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<!-- DEVELOPERS ZONE -->
				<div>
					<div class="header">Developers Zone</div>
					<ul>
						<li class="subheader">
							<a href="./developer/m3/index.html">The M3 Model</a>
							<p>
								Underlying the entire OpenII repository is the M3 model.  This model represents
								both schemas as well as the mappings between these schemas.  This section
								discusses OpenII's data model, how to access this data model, and how this will
								help in the construction of the various OpenII plugin components.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							Constructing Importers/Exporters
							<p>
								This discusses how to construct new importers and exporters for use in OpenII.
								This section includes demonstrations on how to build importers and exporters for
								schemas, mapping, as well as projects.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							Defining Schema Models
							<p>
								In OpenII, the element hierarchy within a data source can be displayed in various
								ways.  This section talks about the various schema models which are currently
								available as well as how to construct new schema models to represent schemas
								in a custom way.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							Building Matchers/Mergers
							<p>
								Underlying the Harmony program is a series of matchers and mergers which
								automatically generate mappings between data sources.  Learn how to construct
								new matchers as well as the mergers which generates a concensus between these
								matchers.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li class="subheader">
							Building Viewers/Editors
							<p>
								OpenII runs in the Eclipse framework which provides a flexible framework for
								adding new viewers and editors to help interpret and work with the data in the
								selected repository.  This section demonstrates how a new module can be constructed
								and the basics on how to connect it with all of the information in the data
								repository.
