					This view displays the raw data structured used to store schemas in the schema repository.  More is
					discussed about this format in the "Developers" section of this documentation.  Displayed here is a
					panel with the schema properties such as name, author, source, type, and description.  Following this
					are panes to show each of the eight types of elements which make up schemas in the M3 model.  These
					include Entities, Attributes, Domains, Domain Values, Subtypes, Containments, Relationships, and
					Aliases.  For each of these element types, the actual data stored in the database tables are
					revealed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This view is most beneficial to users who are working on developing importers in OpenII or want
					better understanding of the underlying data model of the OpenII repository.  Whereas all other views
					in OpenII show abstractions of schemas, this is the one view that shows the model in its complete
					form.
