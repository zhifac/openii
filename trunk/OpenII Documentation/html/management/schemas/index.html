				<h3>Schema Manager</h3>

				</div>
				<p>
					One type of object held within the repository is the schema.  This object is used to represent
					the data model being analysed.  Instead of being constrained to a single format (e.g. XML, Relational)
					schemas are held in a more generalized Entity-Relationship format called the M3 model (discussed in
					more depth in the "Developer Zone" section of the documentation).  Importers and exporters are
					available to translate common formats to and from M3.
				</p>
				<p>
					Viewing of available schemas is done through the displayed manager pane of OpenII which is shown here.
					Browsing of schemas can be done in two ways.  One way to find schemas is by looking at the entire
					list.  Alternatively, if schemas have been tagged by category (discussed below), the user can use
					these tags to find schemas of interest.  One final way to find schemas if through an available
					keyword search.
				</p>
				<p> 
					To perform actions on the schema, the user only has to right-click on the schema for the available
					actions to be shown.  Actions range from importing schemas, exporting schemas, searching for schemas,
					tagging schemas, as well as viewing schemas.  Discussion of these various actions including the 
					various schema views are all discussed in more depth below.
				</p>

			<!-- IMPORTING SCHEMAS -->
			<div class="chapter">
				<h3>Importing Schemas</h3>
				<div class="inlineImage">
					<img src="./ImportSchema.gif" alt="ImportSchema" title="ImportSchema" style="width: 438px; height: 526px;"/>
				</div>
				<p>
					The first major action performed by anyone using the OpenII tool suite is to load schemas into the
					framework for analysis.  To assist with this task, various importers are available for use.  To run
					an importer, right-click on the "Schemas" folder and select the "Import Schema" option.  When this
					action is performed, the displayed dialog is shown.  This dialog has the ability to import either a
					single files or a group of files which exists in a single directory.  If the "file" option is selected,
					the user is requested to provide a file location, schema name, author, and description.  If the
					"directory" option is selected, the user must provide the file directory, author, and description.
					The opportunity is also given for the user to select which directory files they want to import.
					For this option, a schema name cannot be given with the importer instead using file names.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Within the dialog, one other selection involves the type of importer.  This selection dictates which
					types of files can be selected for importation.  The following is a listing of the main importers
					available for use:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>XSD Importer</b> - The workhorse of OpenII, the XSD importer imports all valid .xsd files.</li>
					<li><b>SQL/DDL Importer</b> - Loads relational databases where an .sql file has been generated.</li>
					<li><b>OWL Importer</b> - Works much like the XSD importer, but on OWL files.</li>
					<li><b>Spreadsheet Importer</b> - Loads in schema information from a XSL file.</li>
					<li><b>Domain Importer</b> - Loads in domain information from a formatted XSL file.</li>
					<li><b>M3 Importer</b> - Imports files structured in OpenII native format.</li>
				</ul>

			<!-- MANAGING TAGS -->
			<div class="chapter">
				<h3>Managing Tags</h3>
				<div class="inlineImage">
					<img src="./CreateTag.gif" alt="CreateTag" title="CreateTag" style="width: 307px; height: 303px;"/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Tags are a way to help organize schemas by category.  These tags are especially useful for
					browsing and managing large repositories containing many schemas.  It is allowable for schemas
					to be tagged into multiple categories.  And tags may be hierarchical in nature so that one can
					create sub-categories.  Thus this hierarchical structure, a selection of a tag thus identifies all
					schemas in the category as well as its subcategories.
				</p>
				<p>
					To create a new tag, the user needs to right-click on the "Schemas" folder and select the "Add
					Tag" option.  This selection launches the displayed dialog.  This dialog allows the assigning of a
					tag name and schemas associated with the tag.  If a subtag is desired, right-click on the tag on
					which the child tag should be added to get the same dialog.  In this case, only schemas not in
					parent categories are selectable for addition into the category.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once tags are created, they appear as new folders under the "Schemas" folder.  Expanding these
					folders allow the user to view the schemas contained within.  Right-clicking on these tags also
					allow specialized views to be launched which perform analysis on a group of schemas.  To remove
					schemas from a tag can be done by right-clicking on the tag and deleting the "Edit Tag" option or
					by right-clicking on the specific schema and selecting the "Remove Schema from Tag" option.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- VIEWING SCHEMAS -->
			<div class="chapter">
				<h3>Viewing Schemas</h3>
				<p>
					One action which can be triggered by right-clicking a schema is the viewing of this schema through
					one of the OpenII views.  Two of the main schema views are listed below:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><a href="./schemaViewer.html">Schema Viewer</a></b> - Displays the schema in a tree structure with search capabilities.</li>
					<li><b><a href="./m3SchemaViewer.html">M3 Schema Viewer</a></b> - Displays the raw repository format for the stored schema.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Additionally there are two views which operate on group of schemas.  To access the Affinity view,
					right-click on any tag and find Affinity in the "Open With" sub-menu.  This will launch Affinity
					on all schemas in the category.  This view can also be launched from the "All Schemas" folder.  The
					Proximity view displays a group of schemas in reference to a single schema.  To launch this view,
					right-click on any schema.  It will launch Proximity to focus on the selected schema in reference
					to all schemas in the category in which this schema was selected.  A listing of these views can
					be found below:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b><a href="./../../projects/affinity/index.html">Affinity</a></b> - Identifies/interprets associations between schemas.</li>
					<li><b><a href="./../../projects/proximity/index.html">Proximity</a></b> - Interprets how a single schema associates with other schemas.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<!-- EXPORTING SCHEMAS -->
			<div class="chapter">
				<h3>Exporting Schemas</h3>
				<p>
					Several options are available for exporting schemas from the OpenII repository.  The available
					formats are as follows:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>XSD Exporter</b> - The XSD exporter exports the schema into a .xsd formatted file.</li>
					<li><b>SQL Exporter</b> - The SQL exporter exports the schema into a .sql formatted file.</li>
					<li><b>M3 Exporter</b> - Exports files structured in OpenII native format.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<!-- SEARCHING FOR SCHEMAS -->
			<div class="chapter">
				<h3>Searching for Schemas</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to browsing through schemas, keyword searching is available.  To launch this view,
					right-click on the "All Schemas" folder or any tag upon which searching should occur.  This will
					bring up a dialog prompting the user to enter a keyword.  Note that the keyword is case insensitive
					and astricks can be used to indicate wildcard areas in the keyword.  Once a keyword is entered, the
					<b><a href="./searchResultsViewer.html"> Search Results Viewer</a></b> is launched to display
					any matched schemas.
