				<p>
					This view is ideal for examining a schema and its structure.  In this view, all schema elements
					are marked with symbols indicating their type (e.g. entity, domain, relationship).  The view is
					also displayed in a hierarchical fashion based on its assigned schema model (see the section on
					schema models for more information).  Initially, the default schema model it selected, but other
					models can be selected through a drop-down menu to examine the schema structure in different ways.
				</p>
				<p>
					One way to examine this schema is simply by expanding and collapsing the various parts of the 
					schema tree.  This can be done one level at a time or by right-clicking on an element, this action
					can be performed on all sub-elements.  Alternatively, a search bar is available to find specific
					elements in the schema.  This search field takes regular expressions and will identify all elements
					that match either on the name or description.  The tree is expanded to display all matched elements
					and these elements are highlighted with name matches highlighted yellow and description matches
					highlighted orange.
				</p>
				<p>
					The OpenII tool suite allows schemas to be extended from other schemas.  In such cases, a pane will
					appear at the bottom of the screen to show both what schemas the currently viewed schema extend as
					well as extend from.
