						<h3><a name="faq01">What is the neutral schema format that is used by the OpenII tools?</a></h3>

						The Open II schema importer translates popular formalisms (such as XSD, Relational, OWL, and others) into one common format called the MITRE Meta Model (M3). The schema components in M3 are Entity, Attribute, Relationship, Subtype, Containment, and Domain. OpenII schemata persist in a relational database and are managed by the OpenII tool called SchemaStore.
						<br/><br/> 

						The table below lists the names and definitions of the M3 schema components.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq02">Which schema formats can Open II Import?</a></h3>

						The OpenII tool called SchemaStore imports many popular schema formalisms, such as XSD, RDF, or SQL DDL. SchemaStore translates those formalisms into the MITRE Meta Model (M3).  The two tables below show the alignment of schema components from some of the popular meta-data formalisms to the schema components in the M3 formalism. OpenII has many importers and new importers can be added.<br/><br/>					
						<img src="./support/faq/common-formalisms-to-M3_chart.png"/>				
						In addition to traditional formalisms, SchemaStore imports some big-data schema formats. Correspondence between those and the M3 components are shown in the table below.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq03">What is an OpenII model view; how does OpenII display a schema?</a></h3>

						Some OpenII tools display a schema as a hierarchy.  Hierarchical displays are available in both the Harmony tool and in the Open II Schema Viewer tool. A schema that is stored in the internal MITRE Meta-model (M3) is transposed to a tree hierarchy by one of several Open II model views. A model view determines how the M3 elements in a schema are arranged in a tree view. For example, an M3 entity, an M3 attribute, an M3 relationship, an M3 containment, and an M3 Domain, each may become nodes in the hierarchical display of the model. <br/><br/>  

						Choices for model views include the &quot;Specialization View&quot; and the &quot;Containment View&quot;. A user chooses a model view in either the Edit Schema Properties dialog, or in any Open II window that allows for hierarchical displays of a schema (for example Harmony and Schema Viewer). To change the model in which you are viewing the schema, see <a href="#faq05">FAQ 5</a>.
						<br/><br/>
						An OpenII model view determines whether the nodes that appear in a hierarchical organization appear as roots, leaves, siblings, or do not appear at all.  
						<br/><br/>
						Here is what the same schema about vehicle types might look like in the &quot;Specialization View&quot; and the &quot;Containment View&quot;, side-by-side.
						<img src="./support/faq/specialization-containment-view-compared.png"/>		
						<br/><br/>  
						The Specialization View is organized according to entity type and subtype associations in the schema. The Specialization View is a type hierarchy, as shown in the example above by indenting the AircraftType and WatercraftType entity nodes under the VehicleType entity node. The Specialization View will also display the properties of an entity type indented under the entity node.
						<br/><br/>  
						The Containment View displays the hierarchy organized according to the schema's containment hierarchy as it would appear in an XML document, for example.  In the example above, the Vehicle containment node has the attribute NumericIdentifier node indented below, as well as another property called Driveforce.  Driveforce is a containment itself its proproperties appear indented under it. Note that the Containment View doesn't show that there are subtypes of the VehicleType.
						<br/><br/>
						The Vehicle schema has a Domain called VehicleEnergyTypeCode. The domain value set can be seen by viewing the schema with the model view called Domain. See screen shot below.
						<img src="./support/faq/domain-view.png"/>
						<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq04">Which hierarchical model view is used by default in OpenII tools?</a></h3>

						If the model view assigned to a schema has not already been set by a user (see <a href="#faq05">FAQ 5</a>), then OpenII tools will default to one of the hierarchical views described in <a href="#faq03">FAQ 3</a>.  The default view is based on characteristics of a schema such as the ratios of subtype, relationship, and containment components in the schema.<br/><br/>Because certain combinations of schema components are typically found in certain schema formalisms, the default view is somewhat predictable based on the original formalism of the schema. For example, OWL schemata will typically be shown with the Specialization view. XML schemata will typically be shown with the Containment view, unless a schema is very large. OpenII tools will automatically default to displaying a very large XSD using the Specialization view because its size could exceed memory capacity if displayed with the Containment view.  Domains and domain values are shown with the Domain view.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq05">How does a user change the model view used to display a schema in OpenII?</a></h3>

						The schemata are displayed and mapped using one of the hierarchical model views in OpenII (see <a href="#faq04">FAQ 4</a>). Here are some methods for changing the model view of a schema.<br/><br/>
						<ol>
								<li>
								Change the model view in the Schema Viewer (the pane you see when you  
								double click on a schema in the schema manager): The
								Schema Viewer has a drop-down field at the top of the pane listing all the 
								installed model views. For NIEM schemata, we recommend
								choosing the "Specialization" view.
							</li>
								<li>
								Change the model view in Harmony:  Schemata displayed in the
								Harmony window all have a clickable label after the schema name
								declaring the model view currently used for that schema.  Left
								click that label to get a menu of possible model views.  For NIEM
								schemata we recommend choosing "Specialization".  Remember to save the
								project before closing the Harmony window to retain the latest
								model view chosen.
							</li>
							<li>
								Change the model view in the Project Dialog: Edit Project (right
								click on project name) in the OpenII Manager tab.  In the Edit
								Project dialog, you can change the model view by clicking on the
								schema in the dialog, choosing edit button and changing the model
								view to &quot;Specialization&quot; or some other view.  We recommend changing all schemata in a
								project to the same model view.

						<h3><a name="faq06">How does a user view code lists (value domains) in OpenII?</a></h3>

						There are multiple model views for an OpenII schema. See <a href="#faq03">FAQ 3</a>
						for an explaination of how a schema can be displayed.  To view domains and domain values (enumerated
						values) that are part of a schema or comprise the whole schema, switch the
						model view to "Domain".  This will show the domain data components in the
						schema and their associated value lists in both the Schema Viewer and 
						Harmony tools. (See <a href="#faq05">FAQ 5</a> on how to switch views.)<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq07">What is the most successful way of viewing large schemata in OpenII?</a></h3>

						Some schemata are large and employ a great deal of data component re-use, as with the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM).  
						For large, circular referencing schemata, some of the OpenII hierarchical schema viewers will
						overwhelm memory capacity and degrade matching and viewing performance.
						To avoid these issues, we recommend that large schemata such as the NIEM Core and the NIEM Domains 
						always be viewed in the "Specialization" model view (the type hierarchy
						rather than the containment hierarchy of a schema).  (See <a href="#faq03">FAQ 3</a>, <a href="#faq04">FAQ 4</a>, and
						<a href="#faq05">FAQ 5</a> for more information about hierarchical model views and how to change them.)<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq08">How can a user improve the performance matching very large schemata in Harmony?</a></h3>
						For large schemata there are certain rules of engagement that if followed then performance will not become too much of an issue.  Here are some tips to use in the Harmony tool when matching NIEM schemata or any large and interrelated schema.<br/><br/>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Tip: </b>Use the appropriate schema model view.<br/>
								<b>How: </b>For large XSD schemata, particularly NIEM Core and the NIEM Domains, the schema model view [<a href="#faq03">FAQ 3</a> and 
<a href="#faq04">FAQ 4</a>] should be Specialization.  This will ensure best performance in viewing and matching operations. (If the Containment view is preferred, make sure to follow the tips for reducing
compute cycles and memory usage.)
							</li><br/><br/>
							<li>
								<b>Tip: </b>Match smaller portions of the schema at a time, rather than matching the whole schema at once.<br/>
								<b>How: </b>This can be done either by setting one or more focus areas, or by reducing visible tree depth.<br/>
									<ol>
									<li>
									There are several ways to set focus areas for a schema displayed in a Harmony pane.  One way is to right click on a schema node to get a dialog of options.  Click "Select Focus" in that dialog.  For example, right click on the "Person" node in NIEM Core and "Select Focus".  "Person" and its sub-elements will come into focus -- denoted by dashed box drawn around the Person -- while other parts of the schema will be out of focus -- denoted by node name font changing to italics. You can choose multiple focus areas. After the desired focus areas are set, run the matchers. They will execute only on those schema node sets in focus. Another way to set focus is through node name sub-string searches using the Harmony Search dialog. That dialog is under the Search menu in the Harmony pane.
									</li>
									<li>
									Reduce the hierarchical tree depth being considered in the matching. Large schemata may have many levels (from root to leaves) in a hierarchical model view. The more levels being matched the slower the performance for matching.  The outer levels of a hierarchy can be removed from matching by using the depth bar under the schema in the Harmony pane.  Those levels NOT being considered in subsequent matching operations will be indicated by node names in italic font. With fewer levels being matched, the matching results will return more quickly and the display of mapping lines will less cluttered.				</li>
									</ol>
							</li><br/>
							<li>
								<b>Tip: </b>Hide a portion of the mapping lines in the Harmony pane. (It is important to know that although mapping lines may not be visible, the matches still exist and will be saved when the project is saved by the user.) This will reduce mapping line clutter and improve screen rendering performance.<br/>
								<b>How: </b>Removing some mapping lines from the Harmony mapping display can be done in several ways.<br/>
									<ol>
									<li>
									Set focus areas as described above. The right-click dialog on a node provides choices for setting focus or removing focus on the node and its tree branch . Node sets that are out of focus will have their mapping lines removed from display, making it easier to see matches of interest. Although the mapping lines of nodes that are out-of-focus do not appear in the display, the matches do still exist and will return when the nodes are back in focus. 
									</li>
									<li>Narrow in on valuable matches. You can hide mapping lines by raising or lowering the evidence threshold on the right side of the Harmony pane.  This will cause the display to only show the mappings with an evidence strength specified by the upper and lower sliders. You can choose to see just the mappings with strong evidence, or just those with weak evidence, depending on your goal. Matches that are not currently being displayed still exist and will reappear when the evidence sliders change again.
									</li>
									<li>You can reduce the depth of the schema hierarchy in view by sliding the depth bar below the schema pane.  This will hide mapping lines but, again, those matches are still present. 
									</li>
									<li>Finally you can filter out of view certain kinds of matches using the filtering check boxes in the bottom right corner of the Harmony window.
										<ol type="a"><li>
										The Best Filter, if checked will only allow the highest scored mapping between nodes be displayed.  See <a href="#faq13">FAQ 13</a> for more detail on what is a "Best" match. 
										</li><li>
										The User Filter displays map lines that have a score of 100% due to a user manually accepting the match.
										</li><li>
										The System Filter displays those matches that have not been accepted by a user but were generated by the system.
										</li><li>
										The Hierarchy Filter effects the display of duplicate matches that are automatically generated from multiple references to the same data component. NIEM schemas have a lot of this as explained in <a href="#faq27">FAQ 27</a>. Checking or un-checking this filter can make a difference in the number of mapping lines displayed -- but only when viewing the schema in Containment model view.  If the schema does not repeatedly reference its own data components or it is displayed with the Specialization model view, then the Hierarchy Filter does not make a difference. For more on the Hierarchy Filter see <a href="#faq28">FAQ 28</a>.

						<h3><a name="faq09">What are the different types of matching done in Proximity, Harmony and Unity?</a></h3>

						The Harmony documentation explains how to execute automatic matching and
						also explains the individual matchers themselves.  As of this writing, some
						of that documentation is slightly out of date.  Here is a brief updated
						description of the popular matchers used in Harmony and in Proximity and
						Unity.<br/><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Name Similarity:</b> Compares node names based on their
								similarity, using "edit distance" -- a standard computational
								linguistic technique. As an example "control" and "cntrl" have
								an edit distance of 2 (two characters are deleted) so they would
								have a relatively high similarity score.
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Documentation Similarity:</b> Compares the words found in the
								documentation without regard to order or syntax. For example, if in
								one schema you have an entity with a description that says "Airport
								Code", and in the other schema an entity with description "Code,
								Airport", then this matcher would link them. The advanced settings
								dialog is revealed when the option is checked in the Run Custom
								Matchers.  This option allows the user to control which components
								of a node are used in the matching.  The user can choose node name
								and/or node description.  The user can also choose whether to use a
								built in thesaurus for synonym matching.  For example, choosing the
								thesaurus option will link "Airport" and "Aerodrome".  
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Exact Structure:</b> Used to quickly identify elements that have
								exact name and or documentation string matches.  The advanced
								setting dialog allows for choosing whether to include node name,
								documentation or parent ancestor  when matching schemas which have
								the exact same hierarchical naming of elements all of the way to
								the root. This matcher is primarily used to identify elements in
								XSD schemas which come from shared base schemas. 
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>WordNet Thesaurus:</b> Works identically to the "Documentation
								Similarity" matcher, but uses the WordNet Thesaurus rather than the
								built in OpenII thesaurus for its synonyms.
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Quick Documentation:</b> Instead of matching all elements with
								one another, this matcher groups the schema elements into subgroups
								which are matched first. Then only the elements in the matched
								subsections are matched together to identify linkages. 
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Mapping Matcher:</b> This matcher works similarly to the synonym
								matchers but instead of consulting a fixed thesaurus, it treats all
								the matched elements in the schema repository as a declaration of
								synonyms and uses those as the thesaurus.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h3><a name="faq10">What does the evidence bar in Harmony do?</a></h3>

						Every match is given a score.  The slider bar on the right side in a
						Harmony window can be moved to change which mapping lines are shown.  Use
						this bar to reduce clutter when examining matches.  Clicking on a mapping
						line will cause its score to be marked on the evidence bar.<br/><br/>

				<li>
					<div class="chapter">
						<h3><a name="faq11">Why does the exact matcher produce less than a 100% evidence score for identical strings?</a></h3>

						The exact matcher matches whole strings in the node name and/or the
						documentation string.  And if the Hierarchal matching option is checked it
						also matches on the node ancestry.  A positive match produces a very high
						score but matched strings do not necessarily determine that two elements
						are semantically the same.  Consider the string "Tank" which could be a
						fish tank or military tank.  That final determination that two elements are
						the same is reserved for the user.  Only a user accepted match has an
						evidence score of 100%.<br/><br/>

				<li>
					<div class="chapter">
						<h3><a name="faq12">Why doesn't the Name Similarity Matcher produce a high evidence score for two schema elements with the same string name?</a></h3>

						This Name Similarity matcher takes into account the number of characters in
						the node name.  Two short node names (such as "Id") that are equal still
						have very little overall evidence of being a good match.  They have too few
						letters in their names to support a higher score.  In contrast, two node
						names such as "PersonFirstName" and "PersonName" have more evidence to
						support a match because there are a more characters overall and many of
						those are the same.  See <a href="#faq08">FAQ 8</a> for more information
						on the Matchers.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq13">Why do some nodes have more than one mapping line even when the Best Filter is on?</a></h3>

						Even though the Best Filter in Harmony is checked, some nodes may have more
						than one mapping line attached to it.  There may be more than one best
						match because of a tie for the highest score.  In this case Harmony shows
						multiple lines. The other reason for multiple mapping lines from a node is
						that the best matches are shown for nodes from the left schema to the right
						schema and from the right schema to the left schema.  Both mapping
						directions are considered.  A node in the left schema may have one best
						match in the right schema, but a different right schema node might find its
						best match in that same left schema node.  If this happens there will be
						two map lines coming from one node.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq14">How long should it take to match large schemata?</a></h3>

						If the tips are followed in <a href="#faq07">FAQ 7</a> for matching large
						schemata, the matching should be finished in a couple of minutes or less.
						But if large schema with many interrelationships as found in NIEM domains,
						are matched and the performance tips are not followed then the matching
						could take hours.  In this case, the matching process may run out of memory
						which at the time of writing was set to a limit of one gigabyte for the

						<h3><a name="faq15">Why does it take a long time to save a project?</a></h3>

						When a project is saved all the mappings are saved whether or not they are
						currently visible. There are many ways to filter the mapping lines from
						view making it easier to evaluate the mappings, but they are still present.
						If the project contains large schemata with many mappings it will take some

						<h3><a name="faq16">How can a user know in which XML namespace a schema element is defined?</a></h3>

						NIEM XML Schemata rely heavily on namespaces for scoping definitions.  The
						most commonly used OpenII XML importer does not separate data components
						into their respective namespace schemata. On the contrary, all data
						components referenced in the imported XSD file become part of one OpenII
						schema.  There are some conveniences and some inconveniences with this
						method.  One inconvenience is that the namespace information is not
						imported and is not available in OpenII's SchemaStore.<br/><br/>

						OpenII has another experimental XML importer called the XML Importer
						Separate.  This importer will break up the imported data components into
						their respective namespace schemata. For example, importing an IPED
						exchange schema with the XML Importer Separate, will produce a NIEM Core
						schema, an extension-schema, an exchange schema and many more OpenII
						schema.  A schema for every namespace referenced directly or indirectly by
						the exchange schema is created. To maintain context, a tag group is
						automatically created for the entire set of schema generated during the
						import.<br/><br/>

						The XML Importer Separate is useful but is experimental and has a few
						inconvenient features at the time of this writing.  The OpenII schema names
						given each of the namespaces are based on the cryptic aliases provided in
						ingested XSD.  Because aliases do not have to be unique across schema files
						or across IEPDs, the user will want to rename the schemata to keep them
						recognizable outside the context of their tag group.  Another inconvenience
						with NIEM IEPDs in a shared repository is that namespace subsets created
						for the IEPD are not uniquely named.  Two NIEM Core namespace files in two
						different IEPDs may have very little in common.  We suggest that the user
						change the names OpenII copies from the aliases used in the XSD file.  The
						new schema name should reflect the IEPD to which they belong.  For example
						names should be changed from the cryptic "nc" to something like "Federal
						Traveler NIEM Core" schema or "Emergency Alert NIEM Core" schema.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq17">Why do I see square brackets around a schema element name in Harmony?</a></h3>

						Although it is not allowed in NIEM conformant schemata, some XML Schema
						developers choose to create anonymous types.  When those anonymous types
						are displayed in OpenII, they need a node name.  They are given the node
						name of the element in which they were defined but with square brackets.
						So an anonymous complex type created in the element definition for
						"PersonTattoo" would be displayed as [PersonTattoo].  Of course in a NIEM
						conformant schema, this complex type would have been given a name such as
						"PersonTattooType", so there should not be any square brackets.<br/><br/>

					<div class="chapter">
						<h3><a name="faq18">Why are there so many matches with low evidence scores?</a></h3>

						Harmony matchers are built to be over inclusive, to err on the side of
						matching elements that have only a remote possibility of being an actual
						match.  It is easier for the user to eliminate bad matches than to find
						where the system missed a good match.  The consequence of this is that
						there are many matches with an evidence score as low as .2 and lower.  Many
						times these matches can be automatically rejected by the user, but
						sometimes there will be a good match with low evidence.<br/><br/>  

						The user should explore the matches at different evidence levels to
						determine where a reasonable evidence score cut-off makes sense.  It will
						be different for different schema and project types.  The user may be
						willing to automatically reject matches below a certain cut-off point to
						save manual evaluation time.<br/><br/>

					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					<div class="chapter">
						<h3><a name="faq19">What is a good range of evidence scores for viewing successful mappings?</a></h3>

						For NIEM schemata, we recommend setting the evidence bar to .4 to begin
						with.  After examining, annotating and accepting or rejecting matches from
						.4 and up, then begin lowering the bar.  Until matches are consistently
						looking bad, we would keep lowering the bar.  There can be good matches at
						the .2 evidence level depending on the type of matcher used and the type
						schemata being matched.<br/><br/>

						Another way to view the mappings at a glance is to export them to a
						spreadsheet using the mapping exporter.  Remember to save the project
						before you export the mappings or you will not fine those mappings you

						<h3><a name="faq20">Can OpenII import UML models?</a></h3>

						OpenII has one XMI importer that works with a subset of XMI exported from
						the UML tool called EA Architect.  This XMI importer was created by a
						particular user for a particular subset of UML and XMI which severed unique
						purposes of his project.  OpenII does not currently have a generic XMI
						importer that works for a broad set of XMI implementations.<br/><br/>

						There are several issues that make UML importing a hard problem.<br/><br/>

						<ol>
							<li>
								UML can represent a broad range of modeling semantics beyond what
								a data format schema uses. The set of things needed by SchemaStore
								are the formalisms for an entity, it type or class hierarchical
								relationships, its properties, its associations and its fundamental
								data type or domain.
							</li> 
							<li>
								There are several versions of UML in use today.  And there are many
								instantiations of XMI, the standard export format for UML.  Different
								tools export different unique variations on the XMI standard.
							</li> 
						</ol><br/>

						A developer can create an importer that works for her particular XMI export
						format. This importer can easily be plugged into the OpenII framework to
						become one of the many different schema importers available in the OpenII
						Import tool.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq21">What does "Ignore Validated Elements" do in the Matching Dialog?</a></h3>

						The only way to prevent matches from being overwritten is to accept them
						before running another matcher.  But even if the matches are accepted,
						running another matcher may add mappings to nodes already with existing
						mappings.  If you'd rather not get additional matches for user accepted
						matches then choose "Ignore Validated Elements" option at the bottom of the
						Matchers menu.  With this option selected subsequent matches will not add
						mappings to nodes already having used accepted matches.<br/><br/>

						different kinds of XSD files and is robust so double check whether the

						<h3><a name="faq25">Does Affinity include domain values (code list values and documentation) when clustering similar schemata?</a></h3>

						Affinity was designed for clustering many schemata to find those that are
						semantically similar.  The cluster functions in Affinity use the words
						found in the schema node names and their documentation strings.  It does
						not include the enumerated values and value documentation found in XML
						enumeration types.  It also doesn’t include domain values and value
						definitions found in domain lists imported from the domain spread sheet
						format.  The reason for this is that domain values would contribute to
						false clustering for schema that happen to use similar domain values.<br/><br/>  

						However, if the objects you wish Affinity to cluster are predominantly code
						lists, then you would want the domain values and documentation to be
						included in the evidence for clustering.  Short of adding a new clustering
						module to OpenII, a user can re-import the domains to make OpenII treat the
						domain value as an element and the domain value documentation as an element
						definition.  This has not been tried at the time of writing this FAQ.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq27">Does OpenII help produce NIEM IEPD artifacts?</a></h3>

						The current OpenII tools were not designed to produce NIEM IEPD articats.
						But there are many analysis tasks done before and after IEPD implementation
						that can be facilitated by OpenII tools. There are several other tools
						used in the NIEM community that are specifically for IEPD artifact
						production. Because the OpenII framework is designed to support integration
						with other tools it can be part of a solution to supporting the entire IEPD
						lifecycle. Additionally there are many analysis tasks needed before and
						after IEPD implementation.<br/><br/>

						The current OpenII tools were designed to explore schemata and to find and
						present correspondences.  These tasks are needed in the early stages of
						planning an exchange and also in finding relevant reusable data components.
						The tools can be used to explore existing IEPD schemata and to map NIEM to
						a business domain model.  After the IEPD is finalized, OpenII can be used
						to map the exchange schema to source and target repository schemata. There
						are several NIEM related tasks listed in <a href="#faq26">FAQ 26</a> for
						which OpenII can help.  There are also enterprise data management activities
						that can benefit from OpenII capabilities.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq28">Why do NIEM schemata consume so much memory and CPU cycles in OpenII?</a></h3>

						NIEM core and NIEM domain schemata contain a large number of data
						components to begin with.  Adhering to the NDR, the data components are all
						defined globally and then repeatedly referenced in numerous containments.
						The Open II schema view displays all the repeated references to data
						components.  For example, NIEM Core may have about two thousand unique XSD
						elements, but when fully expanded into an OpenII containment hierarchy view
						it will have about eleven thousand schema display nodes. See <a href="#fa08">FAQ 8</a>
						or ways to improve performance with large schemata.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq29">What is the Hierarchical Filter in Harmony?</a></h3>
						The Hierarchy Filter effects the display of duplicate matches that are automatically generated from multiple references to the same data component. NIEM schemata have a lot of this as explained in <a href="#faq28">FAQ 28</a>. Checking or un-checking this filter can make a difference in the number of mapping lines displayed -- but only when viewing the schema in the Containment model view (FAQ 3).  If the schema does not repeatedly reference its own data components or it is displayed in the Specialization model view, then the Hierarchy Filter does not make a difference.<br/><br/>

To illustrate the function of the Hierarchy Filter imagine viewing two NIEM schemata in Harmony using the Containment model view and matching them using both the Exact Matcher -- with hierarchy turned off -- and the Name Similarity Matcher.  Note that NIEM schemata reuse the "id" data component throughout all its other components.   All "id" nodes on the left will match all "id" nodes on the right. But with the Hierarchy filter checked, only the "id" nodes whose parents also have good matches will be shown.  In theory this will hide a mapping between the DateType's id attribute and the VehicleType's id attribute, but will display a mapping between the DateType's id attribute and the StartDateType's id attribute.<br/><br/>
