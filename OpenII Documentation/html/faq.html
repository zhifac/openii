						<h3><a name="faq01">What is the most successful way of viewing large schemata in OpenII?</a></h3>

						Because NIEM Core and the domain schemata are large and employ a lot of
						data component re-use, OpenII's hierarchical schema view of NIEM can
						overwhelm OpenII memory and degrade matching and viewing performance.
						To avoid these issues, we recommend that NIEM Core and NIEM Domain schemata
						always be viewed in the "Relational" model view (a data type hierarchy
						rather than a containment hierarchy).  (See <a href="#faq04">FAQ 4</a> and
						<a href="#faq05">FAQ 5</a>.)<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq04">What is a schema model view in OpenII and how does it relate to XSD?</a></h3>

						In Harmony and the OpenII Schema Viewer there are different choices for
						viewing a schema called model views.  Those choices show different aspects
						of the schema.<br/><br/>  

						There are three popular model views for OpenII schemata: the "XML" view,
						the "Relational" view and the "Domain" view.<br/><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>
								The <b>XML</b> view displays a hierarchical tree of M3
								containments.  These M3 containments correspond to XML elements.
								(See <a href="#faq02">FAQ 2</a>)  XML types correspond to M3
								Entities and are not depicted in this view.  The element properties
								are displayed underneath the element.
							</li>

							<li>
								The <b>Relational</b> view displays the type derivation hierarchy
								that is defined in the XML schema using extension.  The top level
								nodes in this view are M3 entities which correspond to the globally
								defined XML types. First appearing under each type are the
								properties directly associated with that type.  They are followed
								by the sub-types that extend that type.  The M3 entity
								"AssociationType", for example, will appear under
								"ComplexObjectType".   Under "AssociationType", are its properties,
								followed by all the types that are extensions of "AssociationType",
								such as “ActivityAssociationPersonType”.  The type-derivation
								hierarchy will continue to expand in this manner.
							</li>

							<li>
								The <b>Domain</b> view is used to display domain values such as
								those that are in XSD enumeration lists or were imported from a
								comma separated table of codes and descriptions.  If the domain
								values were imported using the Domain Importer, then the default
								model view will be the "Domain" view.  If the domain values are
								part of an XSD expressed as an enumeration, then the user can
								change the model view to "Domain" in order to see the domain values
								in that schema.
							</li>
						</ul>

						If the model view for a schema has not already been changed by the user,
						then OpenII displays the schema in the "default" view.  The default for XSD
						is "XML".  The default for SQL or DDL is "Relational".  Due to the
						performance issues with large XML schemata, OpenII will automatically
						switch from the default view to a Relational view when a certain threshold
						is passed.<br/><br/>

				<li>
					<div class="chapter">
						<h3><a name="faq05">How do I change the model view used to display a schema in OpenII?</a></h3>

						The schemata are displayed using a default model view based on their
						original format at the time of ingest into SchemaStore. (See <a href="#faq03">FAQ 3b</a>)
						Here are two useful techniques for changing the model view of a schema.

						<ol>
							<li>
								Change the model view in the Project Dialog: Edit Project (right
								click on project name) in the OpenII Manager tab.  In the Edit
								Project dialog, you can change the model view by clicking on the
								schema in the dialog, choosing edit button and changing the model
								view to "Relational".  We recommend changing all schemata in the
								project to being in the same model view.
							</li>

							<li>
								Change the model view in Harmony:  Schemata displayed in the
								Harmony window all have a clickable label after the schema name
								declaring the model view currently used for that schema.  Left
								click that label to get a menu of possible model views.  For NIEM
								schemas we recommend choosing "Relational".  Remember to save the
								project before closing the Harmony window to retain the latest
								model view chosen.
							</li>

						<h3><a name="faq06">How do I view code lists (Domains) in OpenII?</a></h3>

						There are multiple model views for an OpenII schema. See <a href="#faq03">FAQ 3</a>
						explaining some of those.  To view domains and domain values (enumerated
						values) that are part of a schema or comprise the whole schema, switch the
						model view to "Domain".  This will show the domain data components in the
						schema and their associated value lists in both the schema viewer and the
						Harmony tool. (See <a href="#faq05">FAQ 5</a> on how to switch views.)<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq07">How can I improve the performance and results of very large schema matching?</a></h3>

						For large schemata there are certain rules of engagement that if followed
						then performance will not become too much of an issue.  Here are some tips
						to use when matching NIEM schemata or any large and interrelated schema.<br/><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>
								First, for large XSD schemata, particular NIEM Core and the NIEM
								Domains, the schema model view [<a href="#faq04">FAQ 4</a> and 
								<a href="#faq05">5</a>] should be Relational.  This will ensure
								best performance in viewing and matching operations. The first
								group is recommendations to be followed before running a match and
								the second group is for after the matchers have run. There are two
								groups of additional tips listed next that should be used for
								additional improvement in matching and viewing operations. (If an
								XML view is preferred, make sure to use these tips to reduce
								compute cycles and memory usage.)
							</li>

							<li>
								Match smaller portions of the schema rather than the entire schema.
								This can be done several ways.  One is by narrowing the focus area
								for matching.  The other way is to reduce the hierarchical depth
								being considered in the matching.
							</li>

							<li>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Choose a "Focus Area" or set of schema nodes in which the
										matchers will execute thereby putting other areas
										out-of-focus.  There are several ways to set focus areas
										for schema displayed in Harmony panes.  One way is to right
										click on a schema node to get a dialog of options.  Click
										"Select Focus" in that dialog.  For example, right click on
										the "Person" node in NIEM Core and "Select Focus".  "Person"
										and its sub-elements will come into focus -- denoted by
										dashed box drawn around the Person -- while other parts of
										the schema will be out of focus -- denoted by node name font
										changing to italics. You can choose multiple focus areas.
										After the desired focus areas are set, run the matchers of
										choice. They will execute only on those schema areas in
										focus. Another way to set focus is dynamically using search
										strings in the Harmony Search dialog.
									</li>

									<li>
										Large schema can have many hierarchical levels which lead to
										performance issues.  The sublevels in a hierarchy involved
										in the matching can be reduced by using the depth bar below
										the schema pane.  Reducing the depth bar will reduce the
										matching results.
									</li> 
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li>
								Another category of tips to improve screen refresh performance and
								to narrow in on valuable matches is to hide some of the mapping
								lines from view.  It is important to know that although mapping
								lines may not be visible, they do exist and will be saved as part
								of the project mapping.  Hiding mappings can be done several ways.
							</li>

							<li>
								<ul>
									<li>
										One is to change your focus areas as described above. Although
										the mapping lines are there the out-of-focus matches are hidden
										from view. 
									</li>

									<li>
										You can also hide mapping lines by raising the evidence bar on
										the right side of the Harmony window to show only mappings with
										high evidence.  On the other hand, you can lower the upper marker
										in the evidence bar to hide the mappings with strong evidence to
										focus on the weaker matches.
									</li>

									<li>
										You can reduce the depth of the schema in focus by sliding the
										depth bar below the schema pane for each schema.  This will hide
										mapping lines but those matches are still present.
									</li>

									<li>
										Finally you can filter out of view certain kinds of matches
										using the filtering check boxes in the bottom right corner of
										the Harmony window.
									</li>

									<li>
										<ul>
											<li>
												The Best Filter, if checked will only allow the highest scored
												mapping between nodes be displayed.  See <a href="#faq12">FAQ 12</a>
												for more detail on what a "Best" match is. 
											</li>

											<li>
												The User Filter displays map lines that have a score of 100% due
												to a user manually accepting the match.  
											</li>

											<li>
												The System Filter displays those matches that have not been
												accepted by a user but were generated by the system.
											</li>

											<li>
												The Hierarchy Filter does not make any difference when viewing
												schema in the Relational model view.  Since that view is
												recommended for NIEM schemata, the hierarchy filter won't be of
												much use.  But there are times when an XML model view is needed.<br/><br/>

												The Hierarchy Filter works on duplicate matches that are
												automatically generated from multiple references to the same
												data component. NIEM schemas have a lot of this as explained
												in <a href="#faq27">FAQ 27</a>. Checking or un-checking this
												filter can make a difference in the number of mapping lines
												displayed -- but only when viewing the schema in XML model
												view.  If schemata do not repeatedly reference its own data
												components or they are displayed in the Relational model view,
												then the Hierarchy Filter does not make a difference.<br/><br/>  

												To illustrate the function of the Hierarchy Filter imagine
												viewing two NIEM schemata in Harmony using the XML model view
												and matching them using both the Exact Matcher -- with hierarchy
												turned off -- and the Name Similarity Matcher.  NIEM schemata
												reuse the "id" data component throughout.   All "id" nodes on
												the left will match all "id" nodes on the right. But with the
												Hierarchy filter checked, only the "id" nodes whose parents also
												have good matches will be shown.  In theory this will hide a
												mapping between the DateType's id attribute and the VehicleType's
												id attribute, but will display a mapping between the DateType's
												id attribute and the StartDateType’s id attribute.<br/><br/>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>  
							</li>
						</ul>

						The choice of matchers and settings for an automatic matching operation
						will depend partly on your matching goals.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq08">What are the different types of matching done in Proximity, Harmony and Unity?</a></h3>

						The Harmony documentation explains how to execute automatic matching and
						also explains the individual matchers themselves.  As of this writing, some
						of that documentation is slightly out of date.  Here is a brief updated
						description of the popular matchers used in Harmony and in Proximity and
						Unity.<br/><br/>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Name Similarity:</b> Compares node names based on their
								similarity, using "edit distance" -- a standard computational
								linguistic technique. As an example "control" and "cntrl" have
								an edit distance of 2 (two characters are deleted) so they would
								have a relatively high similarity score.
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Documentation Similarity:</b> Compares the words found in the
								documentation without regard to order or syntax. For example, if in
								one schema you have an entity with a description that says "Airport
								Code", and in the other schema an entity with description "Code,
								Airport", then this matcher would link them. The advanced settings
								dialog is revealed when the option is checked in the Run Custom
								Matchers.  This option allows the user to control which components
								of a node are used in the matching.  The user can choose node name
								and/or node description.  The user can also choose whether to use a
								built in thesaurus for synonym matching.  For example, choosing the
								thesaurus option will link "Airport" and "Aerodrome".  
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Exact Structure:</b> Used to quickly identify elements that have
								exact name and or documentation string matches.  The advanced
								setting dialog allows for choosing whether to include node name,
								documentation or parent ancestor  when matching schemas which have
								the exact same hierarchical naming of elements all of the way to
								the root. This matcher is primarily used to identify elements in
								XSD schemas which come from shared base schemas. 
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>WordNet Thesaurus:</b> Works identically to the "Documentation
								Similarity" matcher, but uses the WordNet Thesaurus rather than the
								built in OpenII thesaurus for its synonyms.
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Quick Documentation:</b> Instead of matching all elements with
								one another, this matcher groups the schema elements into subgroups
								which are matched first. Then only the elements in the matched
								subsections are matched together to identify linkages. 
							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Mapping Matcher:</b> This matcher works similarly to the synonym
								matchers but instead of consulting a fixed thesaurus, it treats all
								the matched elements in the schema repository as a declaration of
								synonyms and uses those as the thesaurus.
							</li>

						<h3><a name="faq09">What does the evidence bar in Harmony do?</a></h3>

						Every match is given a score.  The slider bar on the right side in a
						Harmony window can be moved to change which mapping lines are shown.  Use
						this bar to reduce clutter when examining matches.  Clicking on a mapping
						line will cause its score to be marked on the evidence bar.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq10">Why does the exact matcher produce less than a 100% evidence score for identical strings?</a></h3>

						The exact matcher matches whole strings in the node name and/or the
						documentation string.  And if the Hierarchal matching option is checked it
						also matches on the node ancestry.  A positive match produces a very high
						score but matched strings do not necessarily determine that two elements
						are semantically the same.  Consider the string "Tank" which could be a
						fish tank or military tank.  That final determination that two elements are
						the same is reserved for the user.  Only a user accepted match has an
						evidence score of 100%.<br/><br/>

				<li>
					<div class="chapter">
						<h3><a name="faq11">Why doesn't the Name Similarity Matcher produce a high evidence score for two schema elements with the same string name?</a></h3>

						This Name Similarity matcher takes into account the number of characters in
						the node name.  Two short node names (such as "Id") that are equal still
						have very little overall evidence of being a good match.  They have too few
						letters in their names to support a higher score.  In contrast, two node
						names such as "PersonFirstName" and "PersonName" have more evidence to
						support a match because there are a more characters overall and many of
						those are the same.  See <a href="#faq08">FAQ 8</a> for more information

						<h3><a name="faq12">Why do some nodes have more than one mapping line even when the Best Filter is on?</a></h3>

						Even though the Best Filter in Harmony is checked, some nodes may have more
						than one mapping line attached to it.  There may be more than one best
						match because of a tie for the highest score.  In this case Harmony shows
						multiple lines. The other reason for multiple mapping lines from a node is
						that the best matches are shown for nodes from the left schema to the right
						schema and from the right schema to the left schema.  Both mapping
						directions are considered.  A node in the left schema may have one best
						match in the right schema, but a different right schema node might find its
						best match in that same left schema node.  If this happens there will be
						two map lines coming from one node.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq13">How long should it take to match large schemata?</a></h3>

						If the tips are followed in <a href="#faq07">FAQ 7</a> for matching large
						schemata, the matching should be finished in a couple of minutes or less.
						But if large schema with many interrelationships as found in NIEM domains,
						are matched and the performance tips are not followed then the matching

						When a project is saved all the mappings are saved whether or not they are

						If the project contains large schemata with many mappings it will take some

						<h3><a name="faq15">How can I know in which XML namespace a schema element is defined?</a></h3>

						NIEM XML Schemata rely heavily on namespaces for scoping definitions.  The
						most commonly used OpenII XML importer does not separate data components
						into their respective namespace schemata. On the contrary, all data
						components referenced in the imported XSD file become part of one OpenII
						schema.  There are some conveniences and some inconveniences with this
						method.  One inconvenience is that the namespace information is not
						imported and is not available in OpenII's SchemaStore.<br/><br/>

						OpenII has another experimental XML importer called the XML Importer
						Separate.  This importer will break up the imported data components into
						their respective namespace schemata. For example, importing an IPED
						exchange schema with the XML Importer Separate, will produce a NIEM Core
						schema, an extension-schema, an exchange schema and many more OpenII
						schema.  A schema for every namespace referenced directly or indirectly by
						the exchange schema is created. To maintain context, a tag group is
						automatically created for the entire set of schema generated during the
						import.<br/><br/>

						The XML Importer Separate is useful but is experimental and has a few
						inconvenient features at the time of this writing.  The OpenII schema names
						given each of the namespaces are based on the cryptic aliases provided in
						ingested XSD.  Because aliases do not have to be unique across schema files
						or across IEPDs, the user will want to rename the schemata to keep them
						recognizable outside the context of their tag group.  Another inconvenience
						with NIEM IEPDs in a shared repository is that namespace subsets created
						for the IEPD are not uniquely named.  Two NIEM Core namespace files in two
						different IEPDs may have very little in common.  We suggest that the user
						change the names OpenII copies from the aliases used in the XSD file.  The
						new schema name should reflect the IEPD to which they belong.  For example
						names should be changed from the cryptic "nc" to something like "Federal
						Traveler NIEM Core" schema or "Emergency Alert NIEM Core" schema.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq16">Why do I see square brackets around a schema element name in Harmony?</a></h3>

						Although it is not allowed in NIEM conformant schemata, some XML Schema
						developers choose to create anonymous types.  When those anonymous types
						are displayed in OpenII, they need a node name.  They are given the node
						name of the element in which they were defined but with square brackets.
						So an anonymous complex type created in the element definition for
						"PersonTattoo" would be displayed as [PersonTattoo].  Of course in a NIEM
						conformant schema, this complex type would have been given a name such as
						"PersonTattooType", so there should not be any square brackets.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq17">Why are there so many matches with low evidence scores?</a></h3>

						Harmony matchers are built to be over inclusive, to err on the side of
						matching elements that have only a remote possibility of being an actual
						match.  It is easier for the user to eliminate bad matches than to find
						where the system missed a good match.  The consequence of this is that
						there are many matches with an evidence score as low as .2 and lower.  Many
						times these matches can be automatically rejected by the user, but
						sometimes there will be a good match with low evidence.<br/><br/>  

						The user should explore the matches at different evidence levels to
						determine where a reasonable evidence score cut-off makes sense.  It will
						be different for different schema and project types.  The user may be
						willing to automatically reject matches below a certain cut-off point to
						save manual evaluation time.<br/><br/>

					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					<div class="chapter">
						<h3><a name="faq18">What is a good range of evidence scores for viewing successful mappings?</a></h3>

						For NIEM schemata, we recommend setting the evidence bar to .4 to begin
						with.  After examining, annotating and accepting or rejecting matches from
						.4 and up, then begin lowering the bar.  Until matches are consistently
						looking bad, we would keep lowering the bar.  There can be good matches at
						the .2 evidence level depending on the type of matcher used and the type
						schemata being matched.<br/><br/>

						Another way to view the mappings at a glance is to export them to a
						spreadsheet using the mapping exporter.  Remember to save the project
						before you export the mappings or you will not fine those mappings you
						see in Harmony showing up in the spread sheet.  After exporting, sort the
						score column in descending order.  Glance down the mapping rows until the
						matches start to look consistently bad.  That will determine your evidence
						score cutoff.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq19">Can OpenII import UML models?</a></h3>

						OpenII has one XMI importer that works with a subset of XMI exported from
						the UML tool called EA Architect.  This XMI importer was created by a
						particular user for a particular subset of UML and XMI which severed unique
						purposes of his project.  OpenII does not currently have a generic XMI
						importer that works for a broad set of XMI implementations.<br/><br/>

						There are several issues that make UML importing a hard problem.<br/><br/>

						<ol>
							<li>
								UML can represent a broad range of modeling semantics beyond what
								a data format schema uses. The set of things needed by SchemaStore
								are the formalisms for an entity, it type or class hierarchical
								relationships, its properties, its associations and its fundamental
								data type or domain.
							</li> 
							<li>
								There are several versions of UML in use today.  And there are many
								instantiations of XMI, the standard export format for UML.  Different
								tools export different unique variations on the XMI standard.
							</li> 
						</ol><br/>

						A developer can create an importer that works for her particular XMI export
						format. This importer can easily be plugged into the OpenII framework to
						become one of the many different schema importers available in the OpenII
						Import tool.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq20">What does "Ignore Validated Elements" do in the Matching Dialog?</a></h3>

						The only way to prevent matches from being overwritten is to accept them
						before running another matcher.  But even if the matches are accepted,
						running another matcher may add mappings to nodes already with existing
						mappings.  If you'd rather not get additional matches for user accepted
						matches then choose "Ignore Validated Elements" option at the bottom of the
						Matchers menu.  With this option selected subsequent matches will not add
						mappings to nodes already having used accepted matches.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq22">Why do I get a parse error when importing an XML Schema?</a></h3>

						The XML Schema file must be valid and must be correctly referencing any
						import file locations.  XML Spy does not warn against all syntax errors,
						though it does most.  The OpenII XSD Importer has been used for many
						different kinds of XSD files and is robust so double check whether the
						XSD validates in your XML editor.<br/><br/>

						Every now and then, the importer hiccups and an error will halt the
						process.  Try importing the schema again and it may be successful the
						second time around.<br/><br/>

						To fix the syntax error, change line number 478.  Add another pound sign in

						the file, then re-import <tt>exdl-have.xsd</tt>.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq24">Does Affinity include domain values (code list values and documentation) when clustering similar schemata?</a></h3>

						Affinity was designed for clustering many schemata to find those that are
						semantically similar.  The cluster functions in Affinity use the words
						found in the schema node names and their documentation strings.  It does
						not include the enumerated values and value documentation found in XML
						enumeration types.  It also doesn’t include domain values and value
						definitions found in domain lists imported from the domain spread sheet
						format.  The reason for this is that domain values would contribute to
						false clustering for schema that happen to use similar domain values.<br/><br/>  

						However, if the objects you wish Affinity to cluster are predominantly code
						lists, then you would want the domain values and documentation to be
						included in the evidence for clustering.  Short of adding a new clustering
						module to OpenII, a user can re-import the domains to make OpenII treat the
						domain value as an element and the domain value documentation as an element
						definition.  This has not been tried at the time of writing this FAQ.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq26">Does OpenII help produce NIEM IEPD artifacts?</a></h3>

						The current OpenII tools were not designed to produce NIEM IEPD articats.
						But there are many analysis tasks done before and after IEPD implementation
						that can be facilitated by OpenII tools. There are several other tools
						used in the NIEM community that are specifically for IEPD artifact
						production. Because the OpenII framework is designed to support integration
						with other tools it can be part of a solution to supporting the entire IEPD
						lifecycle. Additionally there are many analysis tasks needed before and
						after IEPD implementation.<br/><br/>

						The current OpenII tools were designed to explore schemata and to find and
						present correspondences.  These tasks are needed in the early stages of
						planning an exchange and also in finding relevant reusable data components.
						The tools can be used to explore existing IEPD schemata and to map NIEM to
						a business domain model.  After the IEPD is finalized, OpenII can be used
						to map the exchange schema to source and target repository schemata. There
						are several NIEM related tasks listed in <a href="#faq25">FAQ 25</a> for
						which OpenII can help.  There are also enterprise data management activities
						that can benefit from OpenII capabilities.<br/><br/>

						<h3><a name="faq27">Why do NIEM schemata consume so much memory and CPU cycles in OpenII?</a></h3>

						NIEM core and NIEM domain schemata contain a large number of data
						components to begin with.  Adhering to the NDR, the data components are all
						defined globally and then repeatedly referenced in numerous containments.
						The Open II schema view displays all the repeated references to data
						components.  For example, NIEM Core may have about two thousand unique XSD
						elements, but when fully expanded into an OpenII containment hierarchy view
						it will have about eleven thousand schema display nodes. See <a href="#fa07">FAQ 7</a>
						or ways to improve performance with large schemata.<br/><br/>
