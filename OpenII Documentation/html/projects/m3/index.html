			<h1>The MITRE Meta-Model (M3)</h1>
			
			<p>M3 was designed to include many of the features common to multiple familiar modeling languages,
			including XML Schema, RDF Schema, and the relational model.  Fundamentally, the M3 model is an
			extended entity-relationship (EER) modeling language.  At the core of any ER model are a set of
			entities (with associated attributes) and relationships among the entities.  M3 extends the ER
			model by introducing constructs common to modern modeling languages, such as containments, subtype
			relationships, and domains.</p>
			
			<p>At the core of M3 is the notion of a schema element.  A <em>schema element</em> represents any
			modeling construct that can be uniquely identified.  Virtually every schema element includes a name
			and (human-readable) documentation.</p>
			
			<p>An <em>entity</em> is a schema element that represents information about a set of related
			real-world objects.  Associated with each entity is a set of attributes.  An <em>attribute</em>
			creates a binding between an instance of an entity and a data value (or set of data values).
			Thus, for each attribute, M3 notes the associated entity, the "domain" of possible values, and
			minimum/maximum cardinality constraints for the attribute.</p>
			
			<p>For each entity, M3 allows a set of its attributes to form a key.  For simplicity, M3 assumes
			that an entity will have at most one key, although the key can involve multiple attributes.</p>
			
			<p>A <em>domain</em> represents a set of values.  Many common domains are built into M3, such as
			strings, integers, reals, etc.  Custom domains can also be added, which enumerate a set of
			possible <em>domain values</em>.</p>
			
			<p><em>Relationships</em> are used to connect entities to each other.  A relationship is an
			arbitrary binary relationship between two entities.  In addition to capturing the name and
			documentation for a relationship, M3 includes minimum/maximum cardinality constraints on either
			side of the relationship.  (In practice, most models do not (directly) support arbitrary
			relationships, so many-to-many relationships are rarely observed.)</p>
			
			<p>More specifically, <em>containments</em> represent a structural relationship between a parent
			entity and a child element (either an entity or a domain).  Minimum/maximum cardinality constraints
			are also supported, indicating how many  child instances or data values can be associated with a
			given parent instance.  (Note that if the parent entity is unspecified, then the containment
			links the schema itself to the child entity; this is used in XML schema to denote root-level
			tags.)</p>
			
			<p>Any of these elements can be organized into semantic hierarchies using the <em>subtype</em>
			relationship.  For entities, the subtype relationship indicates that all instances of the child
			entity are also instances of the parent entity.  For relationships, attributes and containments,
			a subtype relationship indicates that the child element is more specific than the parent.  (For
			example, Father is more specific than Parent, a relationship that links the Person entity to
			itself.) 
			
			<p>Of course, different data sources capture different information about a given entity.  The
			<em>derivation</em> relationship indicates that one schema includes the elements from another
			schema.  The elements of the base schema can be further extended by a) adding new attributes to
			an entity, b) adding new elements (such as entities or containments) or c) adding new domain
			values to a domain.  At this time, constraints such as keys or cardinality constraints cannot
			be modified.</p>
			
			<p>Note that most object-oriented (OO) modeling languages conflate derivation and subsets.  In M3,
			one can add new attributes to an entity using derivation.  The derived entity represents the
			same set of real-world instances, albeit with more information.  To conform to standard OO usage,
			the subtype relationship allows both adding new attributes and restricting the set of corresponding
			real-world instances.</p>
			
			<p>Table 1 shows how the M3 constructs relate to other common metamodels.</p>
