					Before schemas can be opened with Affinity they must first share a common Tag.
					Tags may be created, edited, and deleted from within OpenII.  The Manager pane, 
					located at the bottom left of the OpenII user interface, is used to manage Tags.

				<h3>Creating Tags</h3>

				<p>
					To create a Tag, right click on <b>Schemas</b> and select the <b>New Tag</b> menu
					option, as shown in the figure below.
					
					<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/createTag1.png" alt=""/>	
					
					When the Create Tag box appears, type a Tag Name into the appropriate 
					field as shown in the figure below. 
					
					<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/createTag3.png" alt=""/>	
			
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that the <b>OK</b> option in the Create Tag box will not be enabled until one 
					or more schemas are added to the Tag. 
				</p>
				<p>					
					To add a schema to the Tag, in the Create Tag box, click <b>Add</b>. 
					A Schema Selection box will appear as shown in the Figure below.  
					
					<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/createTag2.png" alt=""/>	

					A schema can be selected from the Schema Selection box by typing the schema name in the 
					appropriate field, double clicking on the name of a schema, or selecting multiple schemas. 
					Once all desired schemas have been added, click <b>OK</b> to return to the Create Tag box.
				</p>
				<p>								
					The schemas will now appear in the Create Tag box, as shown below.
					
					<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/createTag5.png" alt=""/>
					
					Click <b>OK</b> again to finish creating the Tag.
				</p>
				<p>
					The newly created Tag will appear as a folder in the Tag Manager. For example, in the figure
					below, the "Cars" Tag has been created and it contains seven schemas.
					
					<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/createTag4.png" alt=""/>
					
					Additional schemas can be added or removed from the created tag. Or, the schemas can be 
					opened with Affinity since all of the schemas in the "Cars" folder share a common tag.					
				</p>

				<h3>Editing Tags</h3>
				<p>
					Once a Tag has been created, schemas can be added or removed from the Tag.

					<h4>Adding a Schema to a Tag</h4>
					<p>
						To add schemas to a Tag, right-click on the Tag name and select <b>Edit Tag</b> from the menu, as 
						show below.
						
						<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/editTag1.png" alt=""/>
						
						Once the Edit Tag box appears, as shown below, click on <b>Add</b>.
						
						<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/editTag2.png" alt=""/>
						
						A Schema Selection box will appear. A schema can be selected from the Schema Selection box by typing 
						the schema name in the appropriate field, double clicking on the name of a schema, or selecting multiple 
						schemas and then clicking <b>OK</b>.	
						
						The schemas will now appear in the Edit Tag box.  Click <b>OK</b> again to finish adding the schema(s) to the Tag.

					<a name="removingschema"></a>
					<h4>Removing a Schema from a Tag</h4>
					
					<p>
						If a schema needs to be removed from a Tag there are two ways to remove it. 
						The first way is to remove it using the Edit Tag box (Edit Tag was described in the section 
						on <a href="tags.html#addingschema">Adding a Schema to a Tag</a>. Select <b>Remove</b>
						rather than Add).
					</p>
					
					<p>						
						The second way to remove a schema from a Tag is to right click on the schema and select 
						<b>Remove Schema from Tag</b>.
						
						<img src="./../../support/affinity/images/removeschemafromtag.png" alt=""/>
					
						Once removed, the schema still exists in the repository but will no longer appear in that Tag.
